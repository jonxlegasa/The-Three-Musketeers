    "# Music Festival Organizer - Python Practice Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This practice problem involves managing a music festival's lineup of artists, their genres, and the schedule of their performances. You will use various Python concepts such as dictionaries, lists, functions, for loops, and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Task\n",
    "Your task is to organize and manage the artist lineup and their performance schedule for the music festival.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Artists and Genres Information\n",
    "First, create a dictionary that includes the artists, their genres, and if applicable, the names of the specific members of the band.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dictionary mapping artists to their genres and members\n",
    "artists_info = {\n",
    "    \"Tame Impala\": {\n",
    "        \"Genre\": \"Psychedelic Rock\",\n",
    "        \"Members\": [\"Kevin Parker\", \"Jay Watson\", \"Dominic Simper\"]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"Drake\": {\n",
    "        \"Genre\": \"Hip Hop\",\n",
    "        \"Members\": \"Solo Artist\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"The Weeknd\": {\n",
    "        \"Genre\": \"R&B\",\n",
    "        \"Members\": \"Solo Artist\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: List of Performance Times\n",
    "Create a list of times when artists will perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of performance times\n",
    "performance_times = [\"1 PM\", \"2 PM\", \"3 PM\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Assign Artists to Performance Times\n",
    "Write a function that assigns each artist a performance time. Ensure no two artists are assigned the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Display the Schedule\n",
    "Use a for loop to print out the schedule in a readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Interactive User Input\n",
    "Implement a while loop to allow users to input an artist's name and get their performance time. Continue until the user decides to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "Complete the steps outlined above to successfully manage the music festival. Remember to test your code to ensure it works as expected.\n"
